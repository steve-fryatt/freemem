<chapter title="Introduction" file="Intro">

<cite>FreeMem</cite> is a free memory display for use on RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.5 or later. It simply displays a free memory bar at the top left of the screen, indicating how much of your total memory is currently being used. To do this it uses <code>OS_Memory</code> to read the amount of RAM in your machine when it starts up (which is why it needs RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.5).

</chapter>




<chapter title="Installing FreeMem" file="Install">

<cite>FreeMem</cite> requires RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.5 or later. It can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc.

To install <cite>FreeMem</cite> on a hard disc, copy the <file>!FreeMem</file> application to a suitable place on your disc. If you want it to run on startup, <cite>FreeMem</cite> should be placed in your boot sequence. On a RiscPC or a machine with the new boot structure installed, this can be done by copying it into the <file>!Boot.Choices.Boot.Tasks</file> directory (<key>shift</key>-double-click on <file>!Boot</file> in the root directory of your hard drive, double-click on the <file>Choices</file> directory that appears, then on the <file>Boot</file> directory, then on the <file>Tasks</file> directory). On older machines you will have to make your own arrangements, although you will probably have built your own boot sequence anyway.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Using FreeMem" file="Use">

Run the <file>!FreeMem</file> application (double-click it from the desktop). Better still, for regular use install it somewhere where it will load every time your machine starts (<file>!Boot.Choices.Boot.Tasks</file> on a RiscPC).
